#text editors vs. IDEs

There exists three kinds of editors for implementation:

1. basic text editors
2. coding text editors
3. IDEs "integrated coding environments"

Basic text editors come with your cpu.  They function to develop text only information.

Coding text editors offer everything basic text editors have, but they also provide tools for coding.

These include:
- Syntactical proofreading
- recomendations
- Auto-complete
- Functionally color-coded tags

On top of the above capacities, an IDE can also:
- compile
- manage files
- debug
- offer third party extensions

These categories are fluid due to the dynamic progression of technology.  

Ex:

Text editors often get updates, changing their capacity limits.
