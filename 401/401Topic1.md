# Java

**Strong Typed Languages**
Languages where the data type of the information is manually determined and type-casted. 

**Primitive Types**
The building blocks for variables.  This includes integers, chars, booleans, floats, et al. 

**Compiling**
A compile transforms the code humans can read into code readable by the computer.  Java compiles whole programs before they are executed.  JS reads code on the fly, line by line, in a run-time environment. If code is compiled successfully, thi does not necessarily lead to properly functioning code.  For example, there may be an error in its logic.  The code may provide out put commensurate with its logic, but that logic may be an incorrect  solution to the problem to be solved.
