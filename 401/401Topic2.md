# Imports

Built-in packages are conatiners for groups of classes and interfaces that are native to the JDK.  Commin packages include jave.util and java.lang.  

## Packages in Intellij

You can make a package manually by right clicking the source folder, and clicking the option to create the package.  Follow the prompts for names and the package space will be created for you. 

## Loops

Both for loops and while loops can utilize counters, although for loops are always explicitly defined in terms of a given counter i. 

Do-while loops check the condition at the end of the loop, rather than the beginning, which means that the loops content will run at least once.  While loops check at the begnning, which entails that the loop content could theoretically not run if the condition evaluates to false.  

## Arrays

Sizes of arrays are defined at declaration.

ex: int[] array = {1,2,3};

ex: int[] array = new int[3];

**Methods**
Finding length
ex: array.length;

Change elements
ex: array[0]=2;

loop for each
ex: for (int i: array){
  //content at i 
}
