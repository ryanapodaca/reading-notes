Reading Journal For Code Fellows

Hello, my name is Ryan Apodaca.

Here a few facts about myself:

- Graduated from Northeastern University with a B.S. in neuroscience and philosophy.
- Played saxophone in the USMC.
- Interested in the nature and appropriate categorization of knowledge, cognition, epistemology, and information.
- Play guitar and piano.  
- Live in Hawaii.

Growth mindset is the understanding that intelligence and talent is not an intractable facility.

This fact warrants optimism and encourages resilience in the face of challenges faced on the path to mastery.

Here are my reminders concerning growth mindset.

1. hard work and diligence beats innate talent ultimately.
2. There will always be unknown variables when measuring intelligence.
3. Relevance realization is more powerful than analytic facility if it is without aim.
