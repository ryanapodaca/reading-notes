# Call Stack

Call:
A call is  an invocation of a function. only one call can happen at a time, which is why we refer to the call stack in terms of stacks.  

The stack was informed by the tray stack in a cafeteria, where the first tray on is also the first tray off. Analogously, the call stack uses the LIFO principle, which means 'first in, last out.'

Functions can be represented in terms of the stack:

function f1(){
  print('top of stack');
}

function f2(){
  f1();
  print('end of stack');
}

f2();

A stack overflow occurs when a function calls itself with no condition for termination.

function f3 {
  f3();
}

This function will stack itself infinitely. Recursive functions are only allowed when there is a condition for function return or termination.

## Error Messages

Reference Error:
Occurs when a variable is used before it is declared.

Syntax Error:
Indicates that the cpu cannot interpret and parse arguments due to syntax errors.

Range Error:
Occurs when an invalid length is specified.

EX: When the length property in the iteration condition of a for loop is atteched to an empty array.

Type Error:
Occurs when the data types to be processed are incompatible.  

Break Point:
Indicates where to the run the code till.  Used to add control while debugging.  You can do this by using a 'debugger' statement where you want the code to stop running.
