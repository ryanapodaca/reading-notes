## Components

The definition of a component also includes the reason it has been adopted in leiu of an objected oriented approach to web architecture and functionality. 

That is, a component solves the problem of UI modularity... a component is a high-order object, which means that it is agnostic concerning its scripting content.  This feature allows developers to design interactive aspects of a webpage that have a determinate functionality and aesthetic design. Furthermore, components can be modified and inherited from, although component independence is highly encouraged. Components are advantageous because they curate all the functional and aesthetical aspects of web architecture, which allows developers to mix and match functional objects in a distributive collective framework.  It is more efficient and inspiring to mix and match with preexisting components than having to create from scratch.

## Props

Props stands for properties ion React.

In React, props function to pass data to and from other components.  They act the same way as arguments being passed into functions.

Props can only be passed in one direction, from parents to children.  Props are read-only, which means that data from parents should not be manipulated by children components.  In other words, props should only be modified by parents.
