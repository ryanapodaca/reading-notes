# REST

Roy Fielding contributed to the construction of the first web servers. He developed the protocal for their communication.  

Regarding machine intercommunication, nested file hierarchies are not well suited for mass distribution of information.  

The WWW collects concepts to be distributed via protocols toward adequate concept representation...

Concepts can be represented for humans or machines.

That protocol is HTTP. 

Concepts are like nouns in cpu speak, and are as variant in form as entites in the world.  

Verbs can be attached to the nouns.  HTTP functions like verbs on nouns, which accounts for the meaning of the term 'polymorphism' in CS.
