# SQL vs. NoSQL

SQL databases are based on tables.

NoSQL databases use other storage protocols, like documentation, key-value pairs, and graph structures.  

SQL are vertically scalable while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.   Due to this, hiearchical structures are more easily suited for SQL. No SQL can be used hiearchically as well, but more considerations come into play. 

MongoDB is an example of a NoSQL database.  It uses JSON or JSON-similar documents to store information.  Being horizontally scalable, increasing servers increases performance.  

Oracle is an example of a SQL database. This is a cost effective solution for table databases.  

*SQL:*
Structured Query Language

*Relational Database:*

A database with inherent relational capabilities, and a syntax and functionality to manipulate the database.  SQL databases use tables that are related to each other in user defined ways.

*Schema:*
Predetermined fields of database variables that can be used to find, retrieve, and manipulate data.  

*NoSQL:*
NoSQL databases are less structured, and therefore more flexible in terms of their user defined relations or lack thereof.  However, since NoSQL databases allow for less strcuture, their documentation can get confusing at scale if not attended to with care, especially since relations are not a necessary aspect of the database.
