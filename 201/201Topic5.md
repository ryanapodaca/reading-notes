# Objects

Everything in object-oriented programming is an object.
An object can be anything, but when we speak of objects,
we are usually dealing with amalgamized collections of data that are utilized to perform a specific function.

## Advantages of object literals

- modularity
- organization
- structure
- ease of implementation
- ease of transformation

## objects vs. arrays

Technically, every array is an object. The inverse is not the case.
This is becasue objects are the most general description of entities within an OOP language. Arrays hold objects. Objects hold objects.  

## Bracket Notation

Usually Dot notation is used to call methods from objects.
ie: object.method();

When a property is held inside a variable, it might be better to use bracket notation instead.
ie: object[propertyName];

## This

"This" is a reserved word which functions to denote that a property/variable is to be fetched from within the object it is contained within.

This is useful for the same reason propnouns are useful.  You wouldn't refer to a person by name every time you referred to them, it would be excessive for the interpretter.  It is further useful because it helps keep the object modular.

## DOM

*Document Object Model*

An API that allows JS to create structures within an HTML document.  

JS is especially useful when developing a highly interactive application.
When websites are interactive as such, JavaScript is used to create HTML structures and control the flow of operations concerning them.
