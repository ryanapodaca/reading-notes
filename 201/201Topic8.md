# Flexbox

## One Dimensional Content

Flexbox is one -dimensional because it can only be insstructed to conextualize content in one direction at time, either through rows or columns.  

### Main Axis

The main axis represents the form the the content should take on the page with repsect to whether its being used through rows or columns.  

### Cross Axis

Can be used to me items either individually or as a collection.

### Accessibility

To best use Flexbox, one needs to notice the conflict between logical order and Flexbox visuals. Flowbox allows you to reverse the order of items on the screen, but this does not change the order they are displayed through the HTML, which can compromise accessibility.

## Float vs Flexbox

Pros of Flexbox over Floating

- Easier to center items
- easily makes all items in a conatiner the proportional to each other throughout size manipulations.
- Can make the multiple comlumns conform to an equivalent height.

Anytime I want to build a front end, Flexbox will be available for use.  I'll likely use it far more often than float.
