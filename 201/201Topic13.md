# Local Storage

HTTP is considered a stateless

Statelessness means that there exists no memory of user input, so the document will reset upon reupload. 

Local storage is the solution to this problem. 

Local storage is more commonly used than cookies.  

## Consideration of Security

Personal information that could be hacked shouldn't be stored in local storage.  

## Local Storage Data Typecasting

Local storage can be used to store entire objects, with the qualification that said objects will be converted to string class form.  JSON methods are used to transform data to and from local storage into its appropriate data type.
