# JS Canvas API

## Canvas Element

The Canvas element allows you to create 2 dimensional representations within JS.

The Canvas element needs to be qualified with height and width attributes.  These can also be modified through the DOM.  

**Important:** Unlike images, canvas elements need closing tags or they won't work properly.

getContext() method is used to access the context through which it is possible to render the canvas, which will usually be some sort of two dimensional representation.  

## Chart.js

Chart.js is a common JavaScript library used to make graphs and stats representing information.  You can import the library through script and CDN link, followed by a link to canvas elements. 

Some types of available Charts:

1. Bar Charts
2. Line Charts
3. Scatter Charts
4. Pie Charts

Charts are much better for comprehending the patterns within information by comparison to tables. Charts show the relative representational correlations between classifications more immediately.

Chart.js provides the means to create all numbers of representations used in scientific journals and industry statistics.  Tables are useful for small amounts of data, but charts are far more useful when curating large data sets.
