# Markdown

Markdown is a basic text editing language. 

The basics of Markdown's syntax covers
- headers
- paragrphs
- emphasis
- lists
- link embedding

All use straightforward signifiers. Some some syntactical operations can use more than one signifier.

ex: lists can use -,_,+, and *, all followed by a space. 

In the case of unordered lists hyphens are more common. 
However, become acquainted with every signifier type in order to adequately interpret others. 


Of particular interest is the fact that one can embed an ordered list inside an unordered list, and vice versa.
However, it is not possible to nest lists within of the same kind(ordered vs. unordered)

1. hello
  - 1
  - 2
  - 3 
2. world
