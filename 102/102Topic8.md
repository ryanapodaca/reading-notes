# Loops and Operators

*Expression*-valid code that results in a value. 

Two Subtypes:

1. Expressions that assign values 
2. Expressions that do not assign

(Any expression of type 2 can be modified into type 1)

(Any expression of type 2 must eventually contribute to type 1 or else unnecessary cpu usage will occur)

*Operators*-symbols which logically process variables.

Coding uses all order of operation rules normally apllied in mathematics.

Types:

1. Unary- requires a single variable
2. relationary
3. assignment
4. bitwise
5. logical
6. bigint
7. string
8. conditional
9. comma

There  exists crossover within these categories:

Negation is both unary and logical.

## Loops

All loops essentially iterate a set of instructions a determinate number of times.  

For Loop analytic:

1. initial expression
2. condition expression
3. increment expression 

loop counts from starting point by determinate increments until it supersedes a sufficiency threshold and returns false.  (Essentially has a conditional embedded within its syntax.)

While Loop-infintely executes determinate instructions until iterations computes false with respect to its specified condition.

## More I'd Like to Know

Other ways one can syntactically formulate loops. (As evident in the quizzes)
