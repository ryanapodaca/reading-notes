# Wireframe and HTML

## Wireframing

Method of curating an information hierarchy for web content. 

Literally the bare bones scaffolding of a website

Can be made with software or by hand.

Notable wireframe tools

-UXPin
-InVision
-Wireframe.cc

## HTML

Hyper Text Mark Up Language

Code that is used to structure websites.

pseudocode is to code as wireframing is to HTML

HTML Elements consist of:

-Opening tag
-closing tag(usually)
-content

Attributes contain information about elements without that info appear to the user.  (Notes, IDs, classes, etc.)

Elements can be nested, but within an appropriate hierarchy.

**Semantics**-The meaning of the element should match its content.  

This helps coordinate with other aspects of development(CSS,JS)
