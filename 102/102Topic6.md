# JavaScript

- HTML is to structure
- CSS is to style
- JS is to dynamism

- HTML is a noun
- CSS is an adjective
- JS is a verb
(hopefully the analogy's reasonable)

Javascript (JS) is a language which allows the user to interact with your page.  

JS can be implemented:

- Externally
- Internally
- Inline

Like CSS, external implemenation is best practice.  

## console.log()

The console is utilized to document and track JS processing.  

The user does not see the console, but it is crucial for debugging and collaborative development. 
 
 console.log() is a method which sends important information to the console(Often from user input)

 JS is fundemntally associated with user inputs and outputs.
 Otherwise it wouldn't be associated with interactivity and dynamism.  

 JS takes user inputs, processes it through logical comparisons, and outputs by virtue of said conditions.

 *Common variable names:*

 -var
 -let
 -const

 var is the oldest, and is not recommended for use.  
 const is only used for constant variables.
