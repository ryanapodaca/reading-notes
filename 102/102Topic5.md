# CSS

ie: Cascading Style Sheets

HTML concerns scaffolding, structure,foundations

CSS concerns aesthetics, style, and details

Used for changes of font, color, borders, etc.

CSS is rule-based.

CSS is so variant that it is further constituted by modules which represent the parameters of properties for the given object. 

## Ways to insert CSS

-Externally
-Internally
-Inline(already internal, but within the element)

External implemenation is standard practice for ease of interpretability and collective coordination.  

**Rule-based language**-Language which functions by defining properties to be applied to specified objects.  

### Isometric Representations of Properties

Color can be equivalently represented in CSS through various standards.  

ex: red == #00ff00 == rgb(0,0,255)

This is part of why the CSS library is so vast.  Different representations can nevertheless functionally define equivalent states.  

## Things I would like to know

What are the major differences between rule based and object oriented programming? 

Is the curly brace syntax similar to Java?
